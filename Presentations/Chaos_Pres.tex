8 electrodes giving us row vectors, $$f(t) = (x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6,x_7,x_8),$$ $$x_i=x(t+i\tau)$$
\item
Utilizing the \textit{Discrete Fourier Transform}, $$F_n=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}X_k  \cdot  e^{-2\pi i n k/N}$$
\item
Multiplying by low and high pass filters, $$\frac{t}{\tau + t},\frac{\tau}{t+\tau}$$
