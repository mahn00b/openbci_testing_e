# 3.0.0

This adds ganglion, wifi, and cyton support to the `openbci` main library. 

If you only need cyton over serial and so not want the additional support, please see [`openbci-cyton`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openbci-cyton).

# 2.2.1

### Enhancements

* Bumped openbci-utilities to v0.2.0 for new accel data support

# 2.2.0

### Bug Fixes

* Calling sdStart and stop would change the writeOutDelay
* Timeout for v1 was set to 10 ms instead of 50 ms.
* Timeout for v2+ was set to 0 ms instead of 10 ms.

# 2.1.4

### Enhancements

* syncRegisterSettings now resolves channel setting object
* Bumped openbci-utilities to v0.1.5

# 2.1.3

### Enhancements

* Can now sync the channel settings from the actual registers on the ADS! Call `.syncRegisterSettings()`
* Bumped openbci-utilities to v0.1.4

# 2.1.2

### Enhancements

* Disconnect did not disconnect from serial port if the device was not streaming.

# 2.1.1

### Bug Fixes

### Enhancements

* Add support for v3 cyton firmware.

# 2.1.0

### Breaking changes

* Significantly reduce the properties in `this.info` object to only have firmware version and number of missed packets. Code dependent on this.info should switch to using `numberOfChannels()`, and `getBoardType()` and `sampleRate()` for accurate board info!

### Enhancements

* Fixes for daisy with new board, specifically hardSet.

# 2.0.1

### Bug Fixes

* Debug bytes was set to always print in processBytes

# 2.0.0

### New Features
* `index.js` file allows for ES6 destructing

### Breaking Changes
* Change name of `OpenBCIBoard` to `Cyton` to follow new naming convention.
    Simply change:
    ```ecmascript 6
    const OpenBCIBoard = require('openbci').OpenBCIBoard;
    const ourBoard = new OpenBCIBoard();
    ```
    ```ecmascript 6
    const Cyton = require('openbci').Cyton;
    const ourBoard = new Cyton();
    ```
* Major change to how board is initialized with removal of `factory` paradigm.
* New dependency called `openbci-utilities`.
* Rejections are errors with messages, so check err.message for info on message, don't expect string.

### Bug Fixes
* Documentation error with `testSignal` function.
 
### Enhancements
* Add more tests for public API functions.

# 1.5.2

### Dependency Package Updates
* `performance-now`: from `^0.2.0` to `2.1.0`

### Breaking changes
* Removed `impedanceCalculationForChannel()` and `impedanceCalculationForAllChannels` from `OpenBCISample.js`

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes #28- Impedance not working properly.

# 1.5.0

### New Features
* New simulator option `simulatorDaisyModuleCanBeAttached` - Boolean, deafults to true, allows the simulation of the a hot swapped daisy board or simulates a misinformed module.
* New `EventEmitter` - `hardSet` - for when the module detects the board is not configured as the options for the module intended and tries to save itself. i.e. when the `daisy` option is `true` and a soft reset message is parsed and the module determines that a daisy was not detected, the module will emit `hardSet` then send an attach daisy command to recover. Either `error` will be emitted if unable to attach or `ready` will be emitted if success.
* Add example for streaming with `daisy` and `hardSet`.

### Breaking changes
* `.setInfoForBoardType()` changed to `.overrideInfoForBoardType()` to elevate it's dangerous nature.
* `.setMaxChannels()` changed to `.hardSetBoardType()` and input changed from numerical to string: 8 and 16 to `default` and `daisy` respectively.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes #131 - 16 chan not working by sending a channel command and parsing the return.
* Fixed bug where end of transmission characters would not be ejected from buffer.
 
### Enhancements
* Separated radio tests from main board test file.
 
# 1.4.4

* Add example of node to python

# 1.4.2

### New examples
* Add example of debug
* Add example of get streaming

# 1.4.1

### Bug Fixes
* Fixes bug where extra data after EOT (`$$$`) was dumped by preserving the poriton after the EOT for further decomposition.
* Fixes bug where any calls to channel set would actually break the openBCIUtilities code as the channelSettingsArray contained an undefined.
* Writes promises resolve when they are actually sent over the serial port. 

# 1.4.0

### New Features

### Breaking Changes

* The setting for simulatorInjectLineNoise has changed from `None` to `none`
* connect() will now fail if already connected
* The constructor will throw an error now if an invalid option is passed
