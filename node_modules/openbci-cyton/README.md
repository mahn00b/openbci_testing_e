## <a name="general-overview"></a> General Overview:

Python researcher or developer? Check out how easy it is to [get access to the entire API in the Python example](examples/python)!

Initialization
--------------

Initializing the board:

```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const ourBoard = new Cyton();
```
Go [checkout out the get streaming example](examples/getStreaming/getStreaming.js)!

For initializing with options, such as verbose print outs:

```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const ourBoard = new Cyton({
  verbose: true
});
```

Or if you don't have a board and want to use synthetic data:

```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const ourBoard = new Cyton({
  simulate: true
});
```

Have a daisy?:
```js
var Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
var ourBoard = new Cyton({
    boardType: `daisy`,
    hardSet: true
});
```
Go [checkout out the get streaming with daisy example](examples/getStreamingDaisy/getStreamingDaisy.js)!

Another useful way to start the simulator:
```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const k = require('openbci-utilities').Constants;
const ourBoard = new Cyton();
ourBoard.connect(k.OBCISimulatorPortName) // This will set `simulate` to true
    .then((boardSerial) => {
        ourBoard.on('ready',() => {
            /** Start streaming, reading registers, what ever your heart desires  */
        });
    }).catch((err) => {
        /** Handle connection errors */
    });
```

You can also start the simulator by sending [`.connect(portName)`](#method-connect) with `portName` equal to [`'OpenBCISimulator'`](#constants-obcisimulatorportname).

or if you are using ES6:
```js
import Cyton from 'openbci-cyton';
import { Constants } from 'openbci-utilities';
const ourBoard = new Cyton();
ourBoard.connect(Constants.OBCISimulatorPortName);
```

To debug, it's amazing, do:
```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const ourBoard = new Cyton({
    debug: true
});
```
Go [checkout out the debug example](examples/debug/debug.js)!

'ready' event
------------

You MUST wait for the 'ready' event to be emitted before streaming/talking with the board. The ready happens asynchronously
so installing the 'sample' listener and writing before the ready event might result in... nothing at all.

```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const ourBoard = new Cyton();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
   /** Start streaming, reading registers, what ever your heart desires  */
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
});            
```

Sample properties:
------------------
* `startByte` (`Number` should be `0xA0`)
* `sampleNumber` (a `Number` between 0-255)
* `channelData` (channel data indexed at 0 filled with floating point `Numbers` in Volts) if `sendCounts` is false
* `channelDataCounts` (channel data indexed at 0 filled with floating point `Numbers` in Volts) if `sendCounts` is true
* `accelData` (`Array` with X, Y, Z accelerometer values when new data available) if `sendCounts` is false
* `accelDataCounts` (`Array` with X, Y, Z accelerometer values when new data available) Only present if `sendCounts` is true
* `auxData` (`Buffer` filled with either 2 bytes (if time synced) or 6 bytes (not time synced))
* `stopByte` (`Number` should be `0xCx` where x is 0-15 in hex)
* `boardTime` (`Number` the raw board time)
* `timestamp` (`Number` the `boardTime` plus the NTP calculated offset)

The power of this module is in using the sample emitter, to be provided with samples to do with as you wish.

To get a ['sample'](#event-sample) event, you need to:
-------------------------------------
1. Call [`.connect(serialPortName)`](#method-connect)
2. Install the ['ready'](#event-ready) event emitter on resolved promise
3. In callback for ['ready'](#event-ready) emitter, call [`streamStart()`](#method-stream-start)
4. Install the ['sample'](#event-sample) event emitter
```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const ourBoard = new Cyton();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function() {
  ourBoard.streamStart();
  ourBoard.on('sample',function(sample) {
    /** Work with sample */
  });
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
});            
```
Close the connection with [`.streamStop()`](#method-stream-stop) and disconnect with [`.disconnect()`](#method-disconnect)
```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const ourBoard = new Cyton();
ourBoard.streamStop().then(ourBoard.disconnect());
```

Time Syncing
------------
You must be using OpenBCI firmware version 2 in order to do time syncing. After you [`.connect()`](#method-connect) and send a [`.softReset()`](#method-soft-reset), you can call [`.usingVersionTwoFirmware()`](#method-using-version-two-firmware) to get a boolean response as to if you are using `v1` or `v2`.

Now using firmware `v2`, the fun begins! We synchronize the Board's clock with the module's time. In firmware `v2` we leverage samples with time stamps and _ACKs_ from the Dongle to form a time synchronization strategy. Time syncing has been verified to +/- 4ms and a test report is on the way. We are still working on the synchronize of this module and an NTP server, this is an open call for any NTP experts out there! With a global NTP server you could use several different devices and all sync to the same time server. That way you can really do some serious cloud computing!

Keep your resync interval above 50ms. While it's important to resync every couple minutes due to drifting of clocks, please do not try to sync without getting the last sync event! We can only support one sync operation at a time!

Using local computer time:
```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const k = require('openbci-utilities').Constants;
const ourBoard = new Cyton({
  verbose:true
});

const resyncPeriodMin = 5; // re sync every five minutes
const secondsInMinute = 60;
let sampleRate = k.OBCISampleRate250; // Default to 250, ALWAYS verify with a call to `.sampleRate()` after 'ready' event!
let timeSyncPossible = false;

// Call to connect
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(() => {
  // Get the sample rate after 'ready'
  sampleRate = ourBoard.sampleRate();
  // Find out if you can even time sync, you must be using v2 and this is only accurate after a `.softReset()` call which is called internally on `.connect()`. We parse the `.softReset()` response for the presence of firmware version 2 properties.
  timeSyncPossible = ourBoard.usingVersionTwoFirmware();
    
  ourBoard.streamStart()
    .then(() => {
      /** Start streaming command sent to board. */
    }).catch(err => {
      console.log(`stream start: ${err}`);
    });

  // PTW recommends sample driven  
  ourBoard.on('sample',sample => {
    // Resynchronize every every 5 minutes
    if (sample._count % (sampleRate * resyncPeriodMin * secondsInMinute) === 0) {
      ourBoard.syncClocksFull()
        .then(syncObj => {
          // Sync was successful
          if (syncObj.valid) {
            // Log the object to check it out!
            console.log(`syncObj`,syncObj);
    
            // Sync was not successful
            } else {
              // Retry it
              console.log(`Was not able to sync, please retry?`);
            }
        });
    }
    
    if (sample.timeStamp) { // true after the first sync
      console.log(`NTP Time Stamp ${sample.timeStamp}`);
    }
    
  });
})
.catch(err => {
  console.log(`connect: ${err}`);
});
```

Auto-finding boards
-------------------
You must have the OpenBCI board connected to the PC before trying to automatically find it.

If a port is not automatically found, then call [`.listPorts()`](#method-list-ports) to get a list of all serial ports this would be a good place to present a drop down picker list to the user, so they may manually select the serial port name.

```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const ourBoard = new Cyton();
ourBoard.autoFindOpenBCIBoard().then(portName => {
    if(portName) {
        /**
        * Connect to the board with portName
        * i.e. ourBoard.connect(portName).....
        */
    } else {
        /**Unable to auto find OpenBCI board*/
    }
});
```

Note: [`.autoFindOpenBCIBoard()`](#method-auto-find-open-bci-board) will return the name of the Simulator if you instantiate with option `simulate: true`.

Auto Test - (Using impedance to determine signal quality)
---------------------------------------------------------
Measuring impedance is a vital tool in ensuring great data is collected.

**_IMPORTANT!_** Measuring impedance takes time, so *only test what you must*

Your OpenBCI board will have electrodes hooked up to either a P input, N input or in some cases both inputs.

To test specific inputs of channels:

1. Connect to board.
2. Start streaming.
3. Install the ['impedanceArray'](#event-impedance-array) event
4. Call [`.impedanceTestChannels()`](#method-impedance-test-channels) with your configuration array

A configuration array looks like, for an 8 channel board, `['-','N','n','p','P','-','b','b']`

Where there are the same number of elements as channels and each element can be either:

* `p` or `P` (only test P input)
* `n` or `N` (only test N input)
* `b` or `B` (test both inputs) (takes 66% longer to run then previous two `p` or `n`)
* `-` (ignore channel)

Without further ado, here is an example:
```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const ourBoard = new Cyton();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
    ourBoard.streamStart();
    ourBoard.once('impedanceArray', impedanceArray => {
        /** Work with impedance Array */
    });
    ourBoard.impedanceTestChannels(['n','N','n','p','P','p','b','B']).catch(err => console.log(err));
}).catch(function(err) {
    /** Handle connection errors */
});
```

But wait! What is this `impedanceArray`? An Array of Objects, for each object:
```
[{
    channel: 1,
    P: {
        raw: -1,
        text: 'init'
    },
    N: {
        raw: -1,
        text: 'init'
    }
},
{
    // Continues for each channel up to the amount of channels on board (8 or 16)
},...];
```

Where:

* *channel* is the channel number (`impedanceArray[0]` is channel 1, `impedanceArray[6]` is channel 7)
* *P* is the P input data (Note: P is capitalized)
  * *raw* is an impedance value resulting from the Goertzel algorithm.
  * *text* is a text interpretation of the `average`
    * **Good** impedance is < 5k Ohms
    * **Ok** impedance is 5 to 10k Ohms
    * **Bad** impedance is > 10k Ohms
    * **None** impedance is > 1M Ohms
* *N* is the N input data (Note: N is capitalized) (see above for what N object consists of)

To run an impedance test on all inputs, one channel at a time:

1. Connect to board
2. Start streaming
3. Install the ['impedanceArray'](#event-impedance-array)
4. Call [`.impedanceTestAllChannels()`](#method-impedance-test-all-channels)

**Note: Takes up to 5 seconds to start measuring impedances. There is an unknown number of samples taken. Not always 60!**

For example:

```js
const Cyton = require('openbci-cyton');
const ourBoard = new Cyton();
ourBoard.connect(portName).then(function(boardSerial) {
    ourBoard.streamStart();
    ourBoard.on('impedanceArray', impedanceArray => {
        /** Work with impedance */
    });
    ourBoard.impedanceTestAllChannels();
}
```

See Reference Guide for a complete list of impedance tests.

#### <a name="init"></a> Cyton (options)

Create new instance of an Cyton board.

**_options (optional)_**

Board optional configurations.

* `baudRate` {Number} - Baud Rate, defaults to 115200. Manipulating this is allowed if firmware on board has been previously configured.
* `boardType` {String} - Specifies type of OpenBCI board (3 possible boards)
  * `default` - 8 Channel OpenBCI board (Default)
  * `daisy` - 8 Channel board with Daisy Module - 16 Channels
* `hardSet` {Boolean} - Recommended if using `daisy` board! For some reason, the `daisy` is sometimes not picked up by the module so you can set `hardSet` to true which will ensure the daisy is picked up. (Default `false`)
* `simulate` {Boolean} - Full functionality, just mock data. Must attach Daisy module by setting `simulatorDaisyModuleAttached` to `true` in order to get 16 channels. (Default `false`)
* `simulatorBoardFailure` {Boolean} - Simulates board communications failure. This occurs when the RFduino on the board is not polling the RFduino on the dongle. (Default `false`)
* `simulatorDaisyModuleAttached` {Boolean} - Simulates a daisy module being attached to the OpenBCI board. This is useful if you want to test how your application reacts to a user requesting 16 channels but there is no daisy module actually attached, or vice versa, where there is a daisy module attached and the user only wants to use 8 channels. (Default `false`)
* `simulatorFirmwareVersion` {String} - Allows the simulator to use firmware version 2 features. (2 Possible Options)
  * `v1` - Firmware Version 1 (Default)
  * `v2` - Firmware Version 2
* `simulatorFragmentation` {String} - Specifies how to break packets to simulate fragmentation, which occurs commonly in real devices.  It is recommended to test code with this enabled.  (4 Possible Options)
  * `none` - do not fragment packets; output complete chunks immediately when produced (Default)
  * `random` - output random small chunks of data interspersed with full buffers
  * `fullBuffers` - allow buffers to fill up until latency timer has expired
  * `oneByOne` - output each byte separately
* `simulatorLatencyTime` {Number} - The time in milliseconds to wait before sending partially full buffers of data, if `simulatorFragmentation` is specified.  (Default `16`)
* `simulatorBufferSize` {Number} - The size of a full buffer of data, if `simulatorFragmentation` is specified. (Default `4096`)
* `simulatorHasAccelerometer` - {Boolean} - Sets simulator to send packets with accelerometer data. (Default `true`)
* `simulatorInjectAlpha` - {Boolean} - Inject a 10Hz alpha wave in Channels 1 and 2 (Default `true`)
* `simulatorInjectLineNoise` {String} - Injects line noise on channels. (3 Possible Options)
  * `60Hz` - 60Hz line noise (Default) [America]
  * `50Hz` - 50Hz line noise [Europe]
  * `none` - Do not inject line noise.
* `simulatorSampleRate` {Number} - The sample rate to use for the simulator. Simulator will set to 125 if `simulatorDaisyModuleAttached` is set `true`. However, setting this option overrides that setting and this sample rate will be used. (Default is `250`)
* `simulatorSerialPortFailure` {Boolean} - Simulates not being able to open a serial connection. Most likely due to a OpenBCI dongle not being plugged in.
* `sntpTimeSync` - {Boolean} Syncs the module up with an SNTP time server and uses that as single source of truth instead of local computer time. If you are running experiments on your local computer, keep this `false`. (Default `false`)
* `sntpTimeSyncHost` - {String} The sntp server to use, can be either sntp or ntp (Defaults `pool.ntp.org`).
* `sntpTimeSyncPort` - {Number} The port to access the sntp server (Defaults `123`)
* `verbose` {Boolean} - Print out useful debugging events (Default `false`)
* `debug` {Boolean} - Print out a raw dump of bytes sent and received (Default `false`)

**Note, we have added support for either all lowercase OR camel case for the options, use whichever style you prefer.**

### <a name="methods"></a> Methods:

#### <a name="method-auto-find-open-bci-board"></a> .autoFindOpenBCIBoard()

Automatically find an OpenBCI board.

**Note: This will always return an Array of `COM` ports on Windows**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled with a `portName` such as `/dev/tty.*` on Mac/Linux or `OpenBCISimulator` if `this.options.simulate === true`.

#### <a name="method-channel-off"></a> .channelOff(channelNumber)

Turn off a specified channel

**_channelNumber_**

A number (1-16) specifying which channel you want to turn off.

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

#### <a name="method-channel-on"></a> .channelOn(channelNumber)

Turn on a specified channel

**_channelNumber_**

A number (1-16) specifying which channel you want to turn on.

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the write queue.

#### <a name="method-"></a> .channelSet(channelNumber,powerDown,gain,inputType,bias,srb2,srb1)

Send a channel setting command to the board.

**_channelNumber_**  

Determines which channel to set. It's a 'Number' (1-16)

**_powerDown_**

Powers the channel up or down. It's a 'Bool' where `true` turns the channel off and `false` turns the channel on (default)

**_gain_**

Sets the gain for the channel. It's a 'Number' that is either (1,2,4,6,8,12,24(default))

**_inputType_**

Selects the ADC channel input source. It's a 'String' that **MUST** be one of the following: "normal", "shorted", "biasMethod" , "mvdd" , "temp" , "testsig", "biasDrp", "biasDrn".

**_bias_**

Selects if the channel shall include the channel input in bias generation. It's a 'Bool' where `true` includes the channel in bias (default) or `false` it removes it from bias.

**_srb2_**

Select to connect (`true`) this channel's P input to the SRB2 pin. This closes a switch between P input and SRB2 for the given channel, and allows the P input to also remain connected to the ADC. It's a 'Bool' where `true` connects this input to SRB2 (default) or `false` which disconnect this input from SRB2.

**_srb1_**

Select to connect (`true`) all channels' N inputs to SRB1. This effects all pins, and disconnects all N inputs from the ADC. It's a 'Bool' where `true` connects all N inputs to SRB1 and `false` disconnects all N inputs from SRB1 (default).

**_Returns_** a promise fulfilled if proper commands sent to the write queue, rejects on bad input or no board.

**Example**

A number specifying which channel you want to get data on. Only 1-8 at this time.

**Note, at this time this does not work for the daisy board**

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the command was sent to the board and the `.processBytes()` function is ready to reach for the specified channel.

### <a name="method-hard-set-board-type"></a> .hardSetBoardType(boardType)

Used to sync the module and board to `boardType`.

**Note: This has the potential to change the way data is parsed**

**_Returns_** a boolean, true if using firmware version 2 or greater.

#### <a name="method-write"></a> .write(dataToWrite)

Send commands to the board. Due to the OpenBCI board firmware 1.0, a 10ms spacing **must** be observed between every command sent to the board. This method handles the timing and spacing between characters by adding characters to a global write queue and pulling from it every 10ms. If you are using firmware version +2.0 then you no spacing will be used.

**_dataToWrite_**

Either a single character or an Array of characters

**_Returns_** a promise, fulfilled if the board has been connected and `dataToWrite` has been added to the write queue, rejected if there were any problems.

**Example**

Sends a single character command to the board.
```js
// ourBoard has fulfilled the promise on .connect() and 'ready' has been observed previously
ourBoard.write('a');
```

Sends an array of bytes
```js
// ourBoard has fulfilled the promise on .connect() and 'ready' has been observed previously
ourBoard.write(['x','0','1','0','0','0','0','0','0','X']);
```

Taking full advantage of the write queue. The following would be sent at t = 0, 10ms, 20ms, 30ms
```js
ourBoard.write('t');
ourBoard.write('a');
ourBoard.write('c');
ourBoard.write('o');
```
